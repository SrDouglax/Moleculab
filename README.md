# Moleculab

## Important!
Moleculab was discontinued by me, Marcos Douglas, as I do not have the necessary knowledge to progress the project in the area of physics and chemistry.

## Description
The Moleculab is a JavaScript-based simulation tool that allows users to visualize molecular structures and simulate interactions between atoms. It provides features for creating atoms, forming bonds between them, calculating angles, and visualizing molecular configurations.

## Installation
To use the Moleculab, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run with `pnpm dev`.

## Usage
Once the simulation is running, you can interact with it using the mouse and keyboard:
- Press the 'n' key to create a new random atom at the current mouse position.

## Features
- Visualization of molecular structures.
- Creation of atoms and formation of bonds between them.
- Calculation and visualization of angles between atoms.
- Interactive simulation with mouse and keyboard controls.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Molecular Simulation project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
